# Step one is to create a static 'impl' library which contains a static
# implementation of clap_init, clap_deinit and clap_get_factor. Here those
# are all in one cpp file, but a common idiom is to have an -entry-impl file
# separate from the rest of your clap, especially in multi-plugin claps.

# Then we use make_clapfirst_plugin, provided by the wrappers, to create the
